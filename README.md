# Payment-Portal-Using-Django-framework-




Payment Portal is a Django-based web application. It enables users to effectively track financial disbursements, manage payments, generate payment requisitions, and obtain approvals. Advanced features like AI-based automation (hand gestures, voice commands, and eye tracking) and QR code-based payments are integrated into the system.

QR Code Generator: Produces QR codes for GPay, PhonePe, and UPI payment information.
Scan & Pay: To finish transactions, users simply need to scan the QR code.
Accepts UPI IDs: For instance, smuk*************.
Features Based on AI and Automation
Hand Gesture Control: Use gestures to navigate and authorize payments.
Voice Command Support: Actions can be carried out by users using voice commands.
Eye-Controlled Mouse: Eye tracking allows you to navigate without using your hands.
Computer Vision Integration: Uses a webcam to control the available selections.
